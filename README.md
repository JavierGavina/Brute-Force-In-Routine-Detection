# Brute Force Algorithm in Routine Detection

This project is an implementation of the brute force algorithm in routine detection with our customized synthetic dataset

## Run main code


```bash
python -m main --data_dir path-to-activities-simulation.csv --dictionary_dir path-to-dictionary_rooms.json
```

Where:

--data_dir: path to the synthetic activity dataset 
--dictionary_dir: path to the dictionary_rooms.json with the correspondencies

Both types of data can be obtained on this website implemented by us ![https://javiergavina.github.io/Synthetic-Activity-Dataset/index.html](Synthetic Activity Dataset)


Run tests

```bash
    python test/test.py
```
