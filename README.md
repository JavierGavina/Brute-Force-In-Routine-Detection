# Brute Force Algorithm in Routine Detection

This project is an implementation of the brute force algorithm in routine detection with our customized synthetic dataset

## Run main code


```bash
python -m main --data_dir path-to-dataset.csv
```

Where:

--data_dir: path to the synthetic activity dataset


Run tests

```bash
    python test/test.py
```
